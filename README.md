1. There will be two screens on the app.
    1. **Main Screen**
        1. It shows a list of food items. 
        2. We can add new food items by clicking on the “Add Food Item” button.

        4. Re-use the same “Add Food Item” form for edit food item functionality.
        5. We can re-order food items by “**drag-and-drop**” functionality.
    2. **Final Food List**
